Collection of scripts and configs for Chaosdorf servers
<http://www.chaosdorf.de/projekte/admin-toolkit/>

This is a Debian package used on all Chaosdorf hosts.

It ships configs and scripts used on all hosts (such as root's .zshrc and a
few nagios checks); it also makes the setup of new hosts easier by depending
on a few Debian packages we use on all hosts.

You'll probably only be interested in the scripts in this repo, but if you
want to build the Debian package for some reason, use:

> gbp buildpackage -us -uc
