These scripts are used to announce icinga status changes to our IRC channel,
#chaosdorf.  Since it is running on a different host than the icinga itself,
it is slightly more complex than necessary.

ircport is the AnyEvent-based IRC bot, based on a similar one by Maximilian
Gass.

notify-chaosdorf is the icinga-notification-script.

The corresponding icinga config snippet:

define command {
	command_name  notify-host-irc-chaosdorf
	command_line  /usr/local/lib/nagios/notify/chaosdorf-admins '$NOTIFICATIONTYPE$ host alert: $HOSTNAME$ is $HOSTSTATE$'
}

define command {
	command_name  notify-service-irc-chaosdorf
	command_line  /usr/local/lib/nagios/notify/chaosdorf-admins '$NOTIFICATIONTYPE$ service alert: $HOSTALIAS$/$SERVICEDESC$ is $SERVICESTATE$: $SERVICEOUTPUT$'
}
